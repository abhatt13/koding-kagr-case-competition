Generating $20.5M in Incremental Revenue
Strategic Initiatives for Midwest State Athletics

Aakash Padmanabh Bhatt
KODING with KAGR Case Competition
November 2025
```

### What to Say
"Good afternoon. I'm Aakash Bhatt, and today I'll be presenting a comprehensive revenue generation strategy for Midwest State Athletics. The challenge: generate $20.5 million in incremental annual revenue to offset NCAA vs. House settlement costs. The solution: a data-driven, seven-initiative approach projected to generate $25.5 million - exceeding our target by 24%."

**Confidence Tip:** Smile, make eye contact, pause after the opening.

## SLIDE 2: The Challenge & Context (1 minute)

### Visual
- Simple infographic showing:
  - NCAA settlement icon: "$20.5M annual gap"
  - Calendar icon: "10-year commitment"
  - Challenge icon: "Maintain competitiveness without cutting sports"

### Content
**The Challenge:**
- NCAA vs. House settlement: $20.5M annual impact (10 years)
- Revenue sharing starting 2025-26: up to 22% of revenue to athletes
- **Bottom Line:** Need 27% revenue growth to remain competitive

**Current Position:**
- Total Athletic Revenue: $94.4M (at NCAA Div I average)
- Strong programs: Football, Men's Basketball
- **Question:** Where do we find $20.5M+ without alienating fans?

### What to Say
"The House settlement fundamentally changes college athletics economics. Midwest State needs an additional $20.5 million annually for the next decade. This isn't just about compliance - it's about remaining competitive in recruiting and retaining top talent.

Currently, we generate $94.4 million, placing us right at the Division I average. The question isn't whether we CAN find this revenue - it's HOW we find it strategically, sustainably, and without damaging fan relationships."

## SLIDE 3: Data-Driven Analysis Approach (1 minute)

### Visual
- Three-column layout:
  1. **Event Data:** "312 events, 6 sports, 2022-2024"
  2. **Survey Data:** "95 fan responses, satisfaction metrics"
  3. **Industry Research:** "Peer school benchmarks (UT Austin, Ohio State, etc.)"

### Content
**Our Methodology:**
1. Analyzed 312 events across 6 sports (2022-2024)
2. Surveyed 95 stakeholders (students, alumni, fans, corporate)
3. Benchmarked against 5 peer institutions
4. Identified gaps vs. industry best practices

**Key Finding Categories:**
- Revenue composition & dependencies
- Sport-specific performance metrics
- Customer segment analysis
- Operational inefficiencies

### What to Say
"Our analysis was three-pronged. First, we analyzed three years of event data - every football game, every basketball game, every ticket sold. Second, we surveyed fans to understand satisfaction and willingness to pay. Third - and this is critical - we benchmarked against peer institutions: UT Austin, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State, and Wisconsin.

This wasn't guesswork. Every recommendation you'll see is backed by data and precedent from similar athletic programs."

## SLIDE 4: Critical Finding #1 - Women's Basketball Opportunity (1.5 minutes)

### Visual
**THE KEY CHART:** Dual Y-axis chart showing interest vs. attendance
- Left bars: Fan interest scores (Women's BB: 85, nearly matches Men's BB: 88)
- Right bars: Capacity utilization (Women's BB: 43.5%, Men's BB: 84%)
- **BIG RED ARROW** pointing to Women's BB with "MAJOR OPPORTUNITY"

### Content
**The Paradox:**
- Same arena as Men's Basketball (12,000 seats)
- Same fan interest level (85 vs. 88 score)
- **But only 43.5% full vs. Men's 84%**

**Why the Gap?**
- Lack of marketing exposure
- Limited social media presence
- Scheduling conflicts (not the sport itself - fans ARE interested!)

**The Solution:**
- Targeted social media campaign (Iowa model: +174% attendance growth)
- Enhanced game experience (pre-game festival, youth engagement)
- Community outreach (local school partnerships)

**Financial Impact:** +1,988 fans/game × 45 games × $49.48/fan = **$4.4M annually**

### What to Say
"This is the single biggest opportunity in our analysis, and I want you to focus on this chart.

[Point to left bars] Survey data shows fans are JUST AS INTERESTED in Women's Basketball as Men's - 85 vs. 88 interest score.

[Point to right bars] But look at attendance. Men's: 84% capacity. Women's: only 43.5%. Same arena. Same 12,000 seats. More than half empty.

This isn't a demand problem - it's an awareness problem. Iowa Women's Basketball faced the same issue and grew attendance 174% through social media campaigns and enhanced fan experience. We project a conservative 60% capacity target - that's 1,988 more fans per game, generating $4.4 million annually.

The demand exists. We just need to convert interest into attendance."

**Mentor Note:** This was a KEY point he loved. Emphasize it heavily.

## SLIDE 5: Critical Finding #2 - Corporate Partnership Gap (1.5 minutes)

### Visual
**Bar chart:** Midwest State vs. Peer Schools
- UT Austin: 16%
- Ohio State: 15%
- Michigan: 14%
- Penn State: 13%
- Wisconsin: 14%
- **Midwest State: 9.2%** (RED bar, highlighted, with gap annotation)

### Content
**The Gap:**
- Industry average: 15% corporate partnerships
- Midwest State: 9.2%
- **38% below where we should be**

**Why It Matters:**
- Corporate clients pay premium prices
- Higher margins (expense accounts, less price sensitive)
- Stable, recurring revenue

**Peer Example: UT Austin**
- 16% corporate partnerships
- Dedicated 8-person sales team
- Tiered packages: Platinum ($100K), Gold ($50K), Silver ($25K)
- Result: $12M annual corporate revenue

**Our Solution:**
1. Hire dedicated corporate sales team (4 people)
2. Create tiered partnership packages
3. Host 6 annual B2B networking events
4. Local business spotlight program

**Financial Impact:** 100,000 additional corporate attendees × $75 avg = **$7.5M annually**

### What to Say
"Corporate partnerships are table stakes in Power 5 athletics, and we're significantly underperforming.

[Point to chart] Here's where peer schools are - 13% to 16%. And here's Midwest State - 9.2%. We're leaving $7.5 million on the table annually.

The solution is proven. UT Austin has a dedicated corporate sales team, tiered partnership packages, and they generate $12 million in corporate revenue. We don't need to reinvent the wheel - we need to implement best practices.

Four dedicated salespeople, platinum-gold-silver partnership tiers, networking events at major games. That gets us from 9.2% to 15%, adding 100,000 corporate attendees and $7.5 million in revenue.

[Source citation] These benchmarks come directly from NCAA financial disclosures and individual school annual reports - UT Austin, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State, Wisconsin."

**Mentor Note:** Be ready to cite sources when asked.

## SLIDE 6: Dynamic Pricing Implementation (1 minute)

### Visual
- Split visual:
  - **Left:** Heat map showing high-demand games (rivalry, tournaments) vs. low-demand (weekday, off-peak)
  - **Right:** Georgia Tech case study box: "$8.2M Year 1, 186% ROI"

### Content
**Current State:** Fixed pricing across all games

**The Problem:**
- Underpricing high-demand games (leaving money on table)
- Overpricing low-demand games (empty seats)

**The Solution: Sport-Specific Dynamic Pricing**
- Football: Rivalry games +20%, weekday games -15%
- Basketball: Conference games +15%, non-conference -10%
- Algorithm adjusts based on: opponent, day of week, weather, team performance

**Precedent:**
- 68% of Power 5 schools use dynamic pricing
- Georgia Tech: +$8.2M Year 1 (12.3% revenue increase)
- Penn State: +$386K per game average

**Financial Impact:** 12% ticket revenue increase = **$4.2M annually**

**Implementation Cost:** $800K-$1.2M (Ticketmaster/SeatGeek partnership)
**Payback Period:** 3-4 months

### What to Say
"Right now, we charge the same price whether it's a rivalry game on Saturday night or a weekday game against a bottom-tier opponent. That's leaving millions on the table.

68% of Power 5 schools have implemented dynamic pricing. Georgia Tech generated an additional $8.2 million in their first year - that's a 186% return on investment.

The key word here is SPORT-SPECIFIC. The football algorithm is different from basketball, which is different from volleyball. We're not just randomly changing prices - we're using data on opponent strength, day of week, historical attendance, even weather patterns.

Yes, there's an implementation cost - about $1 million. But Georgia Tech paid that back in 3-4 months. This is the fastest ROI initiative in our portfolio."

**Mentor Note:** Emphasize sport-specific algorithms (his feedback).

## SLIDE 7: Full Initiative Portfolio (1.5 minutes)

### Visual
**WATERFALL CHART** (the most impactful visual)
- Shows progression from $94M to $119M
- Each initiative as a step up
- **Highlight:** Exceeds $114.86M target

### Content
**Seven Strategic Initiatives:**

| # | Initiative | Annual Impact | Implementation Cost | Net Impact |
|---|------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | **Dynamic Pricing** | $4.8M | $1.0M | $3.8M |
| 2 | **Women's BB Growth** | $4.6M | $200K | $4.4M |
| 3 | **Corporate Partnerships** | $8.2M | $700K | $7.5M |
| 4 | **Premium Seating Expansion** | $4.0M | $1.2M* | $2.8M |
| 5 | **Digital Platform** | $3.2M | $400K | $2.8M |
| 6 | **Merchandise Optimization** | $2.1M | $200K | $1.9M |
| 7 | **Alumni Engagement** | $1.0M | $100K | $0.9M |
| | **TOTAL** | **$27.9M** | **$3.8M** | **$24.1M** |

*Premium seating: Multi-year payback

**Results:**
- Total Net Revenue: $24.1M (exceeds $20.5M target by 18%)
- Overall ROI: 635%
- Timeline: 12-18 months to full implementation

### What to Say
"Here's the complete roadmap. Seven initiatives, $24.1 million in net new revenue.

[Point to waterfall chart] We start at $94 million. Dynamic pricing adds $3.8 million. Women's Basketball growth adds $4.4 million. Corporate partnerships - our biggest single opportunity - adds $7.5 million. And so on.

[Point to top] We end at $118 million - exceeding the $114.86M target by over $3 million. That's an 18% buffer.

Now, total implementation costs are $3.8 million, but notice that premium seating has a different profile - it's a capital investment with multi-year payback. The other initiatives have 6-12 month payback periods.

Return on investment across the portfolio: 635%. These aren't moonshots. These are proven strategies working at peer institutions."

## SLIDE 8: Implementation Flexibility (1 minute)

### Visual
- Three-tier pyramid:
  - **Tier 1 (Top Priority):** Dynamic Pricing + Women's BB + Corporate (addresses mentor question)
  - **Tier 2 (Quick Wins):** Merchandise + Off-Peak Pricing
  - **Tier 3 (Long-term):** Premium Seating + Alumni Program

### Content
**Can You Pick and Choose?**
YES. These initiatives are modular, but here's our recommendation:

**Tier 1 - Start Here (Months 0-3):**
1. Dynamic Pricing ($3.8M net)
2. Women's Basketball Growth ($4.4M net)
3. Corporate Partnership Expansion ($7.5M net)
**Subtotal: $15.7M** (exceeds 75% of target)

**Tier 2 - Quick Wins (Months 3-9):**
4. Digital Platform ($2.8M net)
5. Merchandise Optimization ($1.9M net)
**Subtotal: $20.4M** (meets target)

**Tier 3 - Long-term (Months 9-18):**
6. Premium Seating ($2.8M net, but capital intensive)
7. Alumni Engagement ($0.9M net)
**Subtotal: $24.1M** (exceeds target + builds future capacity)

**Why This Order?**
- Tier 1: Highest ROI, proven at peers, fastest implementation
- Tier 2: Low hanging fruit, builds momentum
- Tier 3: Capital investments, longer payback

### What to Say
"Now, an important question: do you have to implement all seven initiatives? No. But here's how I'd prioritize.

If you only implement Tier 1 - dynamic pricing, women's basketball growth, and corporate partnerships - you generate $15.7 million. That's 75% of your target with just three initiatives.

Add Tier 2 - digital platform and merchandise optimization - and you hit $20.4 million. Target met.

Tier 3 - premium seating and alumni programs - gets you to $24 million PLUS builds long-term infrastructure. Premium seating creates capacity for decades.

My recommendation? Start with Tier 1 immediately. These have the highest ROI, they're proven at peer institutions, and they have the fastest implementation timeline. Build momentum, show results, then layer in Tiers 2 and 3.

But if there are budget constraints or risk concerns, you can achieve the $20.5 million target with just Tiers 1 and 2."

**Mentor Note:** This directly addresses his question about flexibility.

## SLIDE 9: Risk Mitigation & Fan Satisfaction (1 minute)

### Visual
- Two-column layout:
  - **Left:** Risk factors with mitigation strategies
  - **Right:** Fan satisfaction data (NPS: 8.37/10)

### Content
**Addressing Concerns:**

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| **Fan Backlash (Price Increases)** | • Dynamic pricing offers DISCOUNTS on low-demand games<br>• Net Promoter Score: 8.37/10 (high satisfaction)<br>• Georgia Tech saw NO drop in satisfaction |
| **Implementation Complexity** | • Phased rollout (Tier 1 → 2 → 3)<br>• Proven technology vendors (Ticketmaster, SeatGeek)<br>• 6-month pilot before full deployment |
| **Economic Downturn** | • Diversified revenue streams (reduces ticket dependency)<br>• Corporate partnerships often MORE stable<br>• Dynamic pricing adjusts automatically to demand |
| **Competitive Response** | • First-mover advantage in region<br>• Relationship-based corporate sales (not just price)<br>• Enhanced experiences create loyalty |

**Fan Sentiment:**
- Overall satisfaction: 8.37/10
- 85% would recommend attending to friends
- Price sensitivity testing: Fans accept 15-20% premium on rivalry games

### What to Say
"I know what you're thinking: will fans revolt if we raise prices?

Three things. First, our Net Promoter Score is 8.37 out of 10 - fans are already very satisfied. Second, dynamic pricing doesn't just raise prices - it LOWERS them for low-demand games. Students get $5 Tuesday night basketball tickets. Third, Georgia Tech implemented this and saw zero drop in fan satisfaction.

Implementation risk? We're using proven vendors - Ticketmaster, SeatGeek - who have done this 200+ times. Six-month pilot, then full rollout.

Economic downturn? That's actually why we're diversifying away from heavy ticket dependence. Corporate partnerships are often MORE stable - they budget this annually, it's not discretionary spending.

And competitive response - we have first-mover advantage in the region. Corporate partnerships are relationship-based, not just transactional. Once you lock in a 3-year platinum partnership with a local company, they're sticky."

## SLIDE 10: Call to Action & Summary (1 minute)

### Visual
- Clean summary slide with three key metrics in large font:
  - **$24.1M** - Net New Revenue
  - **24%** - Exceeds Target
  - **12-18 mo** - Full Implementation

### Content
**Summary:**
- **Challenge:** Generate $20.5M to offset House settlement
- **Solution:** 7 data-driven initiatives
- **Result:** $24.1M net revenue (24% above target)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate (Week 1-2):**
   - Approve Tier 1 initiatives ($15.7M impact)
   - RFP for dynamic pricing vendor
   - Hire corporate sales team lead

2. **Short-term (Months 1-3):**
   - Launch women's basketball marketing campaign
   - Pilot dynamic pricing for spring sports
   - Design corporate partnership tiers

3. **Long-term (Months 6-18):**
   - Full dynamic pricing deployment
   - Premium seating design/construction
   - Measure and optimize

**The Bottom Line:**
We don't need to guess. We have data. We have precedents. We have a roadmap.
**The only question is: how fast do we want to move?**

### What to Say
"Let me bring this home.

The challenge: $20.5 million. The solution: seven strategic initiatives backed by peer institution data. The result: $24.1 million - 24% above target.

Here's what happens next. Week one: approve Tier 1 initiatives. That's dynamic pricing, women's basketball growth, corporate partnerships. $15.7 million right there. Month one: start hiring, RFP for technology vendors, design corporate packages. Month three: pilot programs launch. Month six: full deployment, start measuring results.

[Pause, make eye contact]

We're not guessing. Every initiative here is working at a peer institution. Iowa grew women's basketball attendance 174%. Georgia Tech generated $8.2 million from dynamic pricing. UT Austin has 16% corporate partnerships.

The data is clear. The roadmap is proven. The question isn't WHETHER this will work - it's how fast we want to move.

Thank you. I'm happy to take questions."

---

## Anticipated Q&A Preparation

### Question 1: "What if dynamic pricing alienates students?"

**Answer:**
"Great question. Three points. First, our student tickets will actually get CHEAPER on low-demand games - $5 Tuesday night basketball, for example. Second, we can carve out student sections with fixed pricing if needed. Third, Georgia Tech and Penn State both did this with no student satisfaction drop. Students actually loved the discount options for weeknight games."

**Data to Cite:**
- Georgia Tech student satisfaction: Unchanged (8.1 to 8.0)
- Discount games: -25% to -30% pricing for off-peak

---

### Question 2: "Why do you think corporate partnerships will work here?"

**Answer:**
"Two reasons. First, we're not inventing this - UT Austin, Ohio State, Wisconsin are all doing it. They're not fundamentally different markets. Second, we mapped the local market - there are 23 Fortune 1000 companies within 50 miles, plus 14,500 small and medium businesses. The demand exists; we just haven't been selling to them systematically.

That's why hiring a dedicated corporate sales team is critical. Right now, it's an afterthought. We need 4 full-time people whose only job is B2B sales."

**Data to Cite:**
- UT Austin: $12M corporate revenue with dedicated team
- Midwest State market: 23 Fortune 1000 companies, 14,500 SMBs

---

### Question 3: "What's the biggest risk?"

**Answer:**
"Honestly? Doing nothing. The House settlement isn't optional - we owe $20.5 million annually starting next year. If we don't generate new revenue, we'll have to cut sports or facilities. That's a death spiral for recruiting.

The implementation risks - fan backlash, technology challenges - are manageable because these are proven strategies. The existential risk is inaction."

**Tone:** Confident but not arrogant. Show you've thought about risks.

---

### Question 4: "Can you explain the Women's Basketball opportunity more?"

**Answer:**
"Absolutely, and I'm glad you asked because this is the most exciting finding.

[Pull up the dual-axis chart if possible]

We surveyed fans: 'How interested are you in attending Women's Basketball?' Score: 85 out of 100. Men's Basketball? 88. Essentially identical interest.

But when we look at actual attendance, Women's only fills 43.5% of the arena. Men's fills 84%. Same venue. Same 12,000 seats. The interest is there - fans WANT to attend - but they're not showing up.

Why? Exposure. Iowa Women's Basketball had the same problem. They launched a social media campaign, enhanced the game-day experience, and grew attendance 174%. We're being conservative - we're only targeting 60% capacity, not 84%. That's 1,988 more fans per game, times 45 games, times $49.48 revenue per attendee. $4.4 million.

The demand exists. We just need to convert interest into action."

**Confidence Tip:** This is your strongest finding. Own it.

---

### Question 5: "How confident are you in the $24M projection?"

**Answer:**
"Very confident, but let me add some context.

These projections are conservative. Dynamic pricing at Georgia Tech generated 12.3% revenue lift - we're projecting 10%. Iowa Women's Basketball grew 174% - we're targeting 37% (from 43% to 60% capacity).

But more importantly, we're not betting the farm on one initiative. We have seven revenue streams. If corporate partnerships only get us to 12% instead of 15%, we still hit $22 million. If dynamic pricing yields 8% instead of 10%, we're still over $20 million.

The portfolio approach gives us downside protection. We'd have to miss on MULTIPLE initiatives significantly to fall short of the $20.5 million target.

[If they push]

And remember - these aren't new strategies. They're working right now at peer schools with similar fan bases, similar markets, similar challenges. We're not pioneers. We're smart adopters."

**Tone:** Confident, data-driven, but acknowledge uncertainty exists.

## Presentation Delivery Tips

### Body Language
- **Stand, don't sit** (if format allows)
- **Open posture** - no crossed arms
- **Move purposefully** - walk to the screen to point at charts
- **Eye contact** - scan the room, don't fixate on one judge
- **Hand gestures** - use them to emphasize key points

### Vocal Delivery
- **Pace:** Slightly slower than conversation (nervous tendency is to rush)
- **Pause:** After key statistics, let them land
- **Volume:** Project to back of room
- **Inflection:** Go UP on questions, DOWN on statements
- **Emphasis:** Bold words in script should be LOUDER

### Chart Presentation
- **Point physically** at the chart (don't just reference verbally)
- **Say what you're showing:** "Look at this bar..." "Notice the gap here..."
- **Numbers first, insight second:** "$4.4 million" then "Why? Because..."
- **Red = problems, Green = solutions** (use color coding verbally)

### Handling Questions
- **Pause 2 seconds** before answering (shows you're thinking)
- **Repeat the question** if clarification needed
- **Answer in 3 parts:** "Good question. [Acknowledge] Here's the answer. [Answer] Here's why it matters. [Context]"
- **If you don't know:** "Great question. I don't have that specific data in front of me, but my hypothesis would be... I'd want to validate that before committing to a number."

### Time Management
- **8 minutes:** Core presentation (Slides 1-10)
- **2-4 minutes:** Q&A buffer built into each slide
- **If running over:** Skip to Slide 10 (summary) and say "Happy to dive deeper on any specific initiative in Q&A"

---

## Technical Setup Checklist

### Before the Presentation
- [ ] Laptop fully charged + charger with you
- [ ] Presentation on USB backup
- [ ] Presentation in Google Drive/Cloud (backup #2)
- [ ] Test HDMI/adapter connection
- [ ] Test clicker/remote (if using)

- **Export as PDF** (formatting won't break)

---

## The Night Before

1. **Practice out loud** 3 times (time yourself)
2. **Record yourself** (check for verbal tics: "um," "like," "you know")
3. **Sleep 7-8 hours** (fatigue kills performance)
4. **Eat breakfast** (low blood sugar = brain fog)
5. **Arrive 15 minutes early** (test tech, calm nerves)

---

## Mindset

**Remember:**
- You know this material better than anyone in the room
- Judges WANT you to succeed (they're not adversarial)
- Nerves are energy - channel them into enthusiasm
- A 10-minute presentation is a conversation, not a performance
- They're evaluating your thinking, not your polish

**If you mess up:**
- Keep going (they won't notice)
- Don't apologize ("Sorry, I'm nervous" draws attention)
- If you lose your place: "Let me highlight the key takeaway here..." (bridges to next point)

---

## Post-Presentation

- **Thank the judges** (eye contact, genuine)
- **Don't rehash mistakes** (to yourself or others)
- **Ask for feedback** (if format allows)
- **Follow up via email** (if appropriate) with any data promised
