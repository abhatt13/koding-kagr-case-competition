## Q&A PREPARATION

**Q: "What if the initiatives don't generate as much as projected?"**
A: "We exceed the target by $5M, providing a 24.5% safety margin. Even if we only achieve 85% of projections, we still meet the requirement. Plus, every initiative is based on proven success at peer institutions."

**Q: "Why should we trust these numbers?"**
A: "Three reasons: First, our projections are conservative - Texas saw 12% with dynamic pricing, we're modeling 12%. Second, we analyzed 312 actual events, not hypotheticals. Third, every initiative has worked at similar schools."

**Q: "What about fan backlash to dynamic pricing?"**
A: "Our fan satisfaction is 8.37/10 with 70% promoters. We'll protect season ticket holders with lowest-price guarantees. Dynamic pricing is now standard at major universities including Purdue, Georgetown, and Texas."

**Q: "Can we prioritize - which initiatives are must-haves?"**
A: "Top 3: (1) Dynamic Pricing - $4.8M, low cost, immediate ROI. (2) Corporate Partnerships - $7.5M, proven model. (3) Women's Basketball - $4.4M, our own data shows it works. These three alone generate $16.7M."

**Q: "What happens in Year 2?"**
A: "Year 1 net is $23.2M. Year 2 is even better - premium seating becomes profitable (+$1.2M swing), established corporate relationships grow, and we optimize based on Year 1 learnings. Year 2 projected: $26-28M."
