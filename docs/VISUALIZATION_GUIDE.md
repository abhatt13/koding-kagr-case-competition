## 🎯 Talking Points for Each Visualization

### 1. Challenge Gauge
> "The NCAA vs. House settlement requires us to generate $20.5 million in new annual revenue. This isn't optional—it's critical to maintaining our competitive excellence and supporting our student-athletes."

### 2. Current State Dashboard
> "We currently generate $94.4 million annually. Ticket sales represent 42% of revenue, followed by concessions at 31%, parking at 15%, and merchandise at 12%. We have 312 events across 6 sports with an average attendance of 13,500 and 68.5% capacity utilization."

### 3. Gap Analysis
> "When we compare ourselves to Power 5 conference peers, we see significant opportunities. We're 38% below peers in corporate partnerships, 33% below in premium seating, and have substantial room to grow in digital engagement and women's sports attendance."

### 4. Women's Basketball Paradox
> "This is our biggest single opportunity. Fan interest in women's basketball is 85—nearly identical to men's basketball—but our capacity utilization is only 43.5% compared to 84% for men. If we simply bring women's basketball attendance to 60% capacity, that's $4 million in annual revenue."

### 5. Initiative Bubbles
> "We've identified 7 strategic initiatives, carefully balanced across quick wins, short-term gains, and long-term strategic bets. Dynamic pricing and alumni programs can be implemented in 3 months. Women's basketball growth and digital platforms in 6 months. Corporate partnerships in 9 months. And premium seating as our long-term capacity investment."

### 6. Revenue Waterfall
> "Here's our path from $94 million to $120 million. Each step builds on the last. Dynamic pricing adds $4.2M, women's basketball growth adds $4.0M, corporate partnerships add $7.5M—our largest single initiative. Combined with premium seating, digital, merchandise, and alumni programs, we exceed our $20.5M target by $4.6 million."

### 7. Implementation Roadmap
> "This is achievable in 18 months. By the end of Q1, we'll have quick wins generating $5.1M. By mid-year, Phase 1 completes with $14.6M. By year-end, we'll have exceeded our $20.5M target. The final initiatives come online in year two for continued growth."

### 8. ROI Comparison
> "Every initiative is above the break-even line. Dynamic pricing has the highest ROI at 2,700%—requiring only $150K to generate $4.2M annually. Corporate partnerships require $500K but return $7.5M annually. Even premium seating, our largest investment at $8.5M, delivers $2.8M annually with a 3-year payback."

### 9. Executive Summary
> "In summary: We face a $20.5M challenge. We have 7 strategic initiatives. We project $25.1M in new revenue—exceeding our target by 22%. Average ROI is 723%. Risk is low at 3.2 out of 10. Timeline is 18 months. And we maintain fan satisfaction above 4.0 throughout."
